## Android Kotlin Mentor Coding Challenge 💻

Thank you 🙏 for taking the time to implement this coding challenge to build a small Android App using *Kotlin*, *Retrofit* and *Corroutines*.

## Conditions

* Take 2-4 hours to implement your project.
* Use coding best practices.
* Create and share the Repository used to store your solution.


## Coding Challenge 👩‍💻 👨‍💻

Your friend is the owner of Cinematrix, a very traditional cinema. She is not able to have an updated list of the movies currently playing. 
Because you are an Android Developer, you want to help her building a prototype Android App, that will help her understand the usage of technology, and how she could centralize the data using an API(Backend), and how fast and simple you could query the Movies' information on an Android App. 

## Design and implment an Android App that:
* Let's you query the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) database, for example search for movies that title includes the word 'batman':
  * https://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=a9a1b302&s=batman
  * Note: feel free to use our apikey *a9a1b302* or [create your own](https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx)
* Displays a list of cards with the basic information about the movies found:
  * Title
  * Year
  * Poster
* Let's you click on the Movie and this takes you to a detail view where you can see more information about the Movie:
  * Details API Query Example: https://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=a9a1b302&i=tt0372784
  * Addional Movie Detail View should contain at least the following information:
    * Title   
    * Year
    * Poster
    * Genre
    * Director
    * Actors

# Expected Quality Attributes:
* Using coding best practices.
* SOLID principles.
* Avoid hardcoding query paramters or constants.
* Clear usage of an architeture style (MVVM / Clean / Other)
* Correct ussage of Data types.
  
## Nice to Have
* Usage of Depdencies injection with Hilt
* Connect with a the API using Corroutines.
* Android Navigation.


# Desired technology stack:
* Kotlin 
* Retrofit
* Jetpack(ROOM, Hilt, Navigation)

## Submit your solution

Once you're done, please send us a confirmation email with your repository link to [talento@ada-school.org](mailto:talento@ada-school.org). After you submit your code, we will contact you to discuss next steps. 

Good luck! 💪
