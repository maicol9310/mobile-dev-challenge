## Android Kotlin Mentor 👩🏻‍💻 👨🏾‍💻 👨🏻‍💻 👩🏽‍💻 Coding Challenge

Thank you 🙏 for taking the time to implement this coding challenge to build a small Android App using *Kotlin*, *Retrofit* and *Corroutines*.

## Conditions

* Take 2-4 hours to implement your project.
* Use coding best practices.
* Create a fork of this repo and share your solution when finished.


## Coding Challenge 💻

Your friend is the owner of Cinematrix, a very traditional cinema. She is not able to have an updated list of the movies currently playing. 
Because you are an Android Developer, you want to help her building a prototype Android App, that will help her understand the usage of technology, and how she could centralize the data using an API(Backend), and how fast and simple you could query the Movies' information on an Android App. 

## Design and implment an Android App that:
* Allows you to query the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) database, for example search for movies that title includes the word 'batman':
  * https://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=a9a1b302&s=batman
  * Note: feel free to use our apikey *a9a1b302* or [create your own](https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx)
* Displays a list of cards with the basic information about the movies found:
  * Title
  * Year
  * Poster
* Allows you to click on the Movie and this takes you to a detail view where you can see more information about the Movie:
  * Details API Query Example: https://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=a9a1b302&i=tt0372784
  * Addional Movie Detail View should contain at least the following information:
    * Title   
    * Year
    * Poster
    * Genre
    * Director
    * Actors

# Expected Quality Attributes:
* Use coding best practices: Code style, naming conventions, etc.
* Correct data modeling to store information in a flexible way.
* Create reusable components and functions.
* SOLID principles.
* Clear usage of an architeture style (MVVM / Clean / Other)
* Correct ussage of Data types.
  
## Nice to Have
* Usage of Depdencies injection with Hilt
* Connect with a the API using Corroutines.
* Android Navigation.


# Desired technology stack:
* Kotlin 
* Retrofit
* Jetpack(ROOM, Hilt, Navigation)

## Submit your solution

Once you're done, please send us an email to [tech@ada-school.org](mailto:tech@ada-school.org) with the subject: TECH_CHALLENGE_[YOUR NAME] and do not forget to include the link to your repository with the solution. After you submit your code, we will review it and contact you to discuss next steps. 

Good luck! 💪
